# Motors

## Brushless motors

Brushless motors consist of 2 main sections: rotors and stators.

* Rotors are the moving parts, they rotate. They have magnets glued inside in a circular pattern.
* Stators are the non-moving parts. It also has the electromagnets fitted onto it.

### Inrunners and Outrunners

There are once again 2 types of motors. Outrunners are those, that have the outershell moving. Inrunners have only a moving shaft. Inrunners are used more for RC cars and stuff.

### Numbers on motors

Motors have usually 2 sets of numbers on them: first for size and second for speed. 

For example, EMAX's RS1306 4000KV motors:

* the first set of numbers tells us the size: 13 is rotor (sometimes motor) diameter and 06 is the rotor (sometimes motor) height.
* Note: there might be sometimes a number added to this with a slash: that number displays the number of wire turns for each pole
* second set of numbers is the number of revolutions per minute that the motor will turn when 1V is applied with no load attached to the motor: As per example, this would be 4000 revolutions per minute for 1Volt.
